# Gmail-nodemailer-test
This project demonstrates how to send automated emails using Node.js + Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP. It uses an App Password (instead of normal login) for secure and reliable email delivery without needing Gmail API setup.

## What I Explored

**Today I explored how to send emails through automation using Node.js, Gmail SMTP & Nodemailer!**  
As part of a self-learning experiment, I created a script that:

- Logs into my Gmail account using an App Password
- Sends an email to myself
- Verifies the email delivery and content
- Uses Nodemailer with Gmailâ€™s SMTP server

---

## Tech Used
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/)
- Gmail SMTP
- Gmail App Passwords (with 2-Step Verification enabled)


## Key Takeaways:
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a powerful way to send emails programmatically.
- Gmail requires App Passwords if you're using third-party tools like Nodemailer.
- This approach is helpful for sending automated reports, test results, or alerts during automation.

## Steps I Followed:

### 1. Install Nodemailer
     npm install nodemailer 
     
### 2. Enable 2-Step Verification in Gmail
     Go to: (https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
     Select "Mail" and "Windows Computer" (or any device), and generate your App Password.

## 3. Create a file sendEmail.js with the following code:
```js
    const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");
    const userEmail = "your_email@gmail.com"; // replace with your email const appPassword = "your_generated_app_password"; // NOT your Gmail passwordconst transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
      service: "gmail",
      auth: {
        user: userEmail,
        pass: appPassword,
      },
    });
    const mailOptions = {
      from: userEmail,
      to: userEmail, // send to selfsubject: "Test Mail from Automation Script",
      text: "This is a test email sent using Node.js + Gmail SMTP + App Password.",
    };
    transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
      if (error) {
        return console.log("Error:", error);
      }
      console.log("Email sent:", info.response);
    }); 
```

### 4. Run your script:
    node sendEmail.js

## Result:
Email delivered successfully to my Gmail inbox.

## Pros:
1. Free & Easy to set up
2. No need for Google Cloud billing or OAuth setup
3. Useful for automated test notifications & CI/CD alerts
4. Secure with Gmail App Passwords
5. Works well for small-scale email use-cases


## Cons:
1. Cannot read inbox emails (Send only)
2. Gmail SMTP has sending limits (~500 emails/day)
3. Needs manual setup of App Passwords (only works with 2FA enabled)
4. Not suitable for high-volume or transactional systems
5. Less flexibility than Gmail API (e.g., no label, thread, or read access)
